# SMARTLEARN : 3-Tier-Web-App-AWS
3-tier web app that stores students and professors real-time data.


### Abstract :
The project "SMARTLEARN" aims to develop a revolutionary learning web solution that adopts a student-centric approach. Through the creation of a smart academic web application, students will benefit from enhanced engagement in courses and university activities. The project involves analyzing the needs of a fictitious university, designing a solution, conducting a risk assessment following ISO 27001 standards, and proposing a security policy for sensitive data management. By implementing critical portions of the design in a lab environment, students will gain practical experience in architecting secure cloud infrastructures.

### Introduction :

Welcome to the "SMARTLEARN" project, where innovation meets education! This project invites students to design a cutting-edge learning web solution for a fictitious university, focusing on enhancing student engagement and academic performance. Through a series of activities including needs analysis, solution design, risk assessment, and security policy development, participants will delve into the world of cloud infrastructure architecture. By implementing critical components of the design in a lab environment, students will gain practical skills and insights into creating secure and student-centric academic applications. Join us on this exciting journey to shape the future of education with the "SMARTLEARN" project.
