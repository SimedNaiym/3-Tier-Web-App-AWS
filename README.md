# SMARTLEARN : 3-Tier-Web-App-AWS
3-tier web app that stores students and professors real-time data.


### Abstract :
The project "SMARTLEARN" aims to develop a revolutionary learning web solution that adopts a student-centric approach. Through the creation of a smart academic web application, students will benefit from enhanced engagement in courses and university activities. The project involves analyzing the needs of a fictitious university, designing a solution, conducting a risk assessment following ISO 27001 standards, and proposing a security policy for sensitive data management. By implementing critical portions of the design in a lab environment, students will gain practical experience in architecting secure cloud infrastructures.

### Introduction :

Welcome to the "SMARTLEARN" project, where innovation meets education! This project invites students to design a cutting-edge learning web solution for a fictitious university, focusing on enhancing student engagement and academic performance. Through a series of activities including needs analysis, solution design, risk assessment, and security policy development, participants will delve into the world of cloud infrastructure architecture. By implementing critical components of the design in a lab environment, students will gain practical skills and insights into creating secure and student-centric academic applications. Join us on this exciting journey to shape the future of education with the "SMARTLEARN" project.

### ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW :

The cloud architecture for the project spans three regions: Afrique, Europe, and Asie-Pacifique. This multi-region setup aims to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability for the smart academic web application designed for the fictitious university. By distributing resources across these regions, the architecture enhances performance and resilience, catering to users in different geographical locations.

In each region, the architecture includes Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and Availability Zones (AZs) to segment and isolate resources, optimize network traffic, and provide redundancy. The use of multiple regions allows for geographic diversity, reducing the risk of downtime due to regional outages or disruptions.

Furthermore, data replication and synchronization mechanisms can be implemented across regions to ensure data consistency and disaster recovery capabilities. By leveraging cloud services and technologies tailored to each region's requirements and regulations, the architecture can effectively support the smart academic web application's operations and data management across Afrique, Europe, and Asie-Pacifique.
